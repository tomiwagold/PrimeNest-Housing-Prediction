# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features that influence house prices. Each row in the dataset represents a house with attributes including but not limited to:
- parking space
- Number of rooms
- Number of conveniences
- Location
- Building age
- Width
- Distance to centre
- Price

## Model
Linear regression was chosen for this task due to its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).

### Key Steps:
1. **Model Training:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Training the linear regression model
2. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Measuring performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error and R-squared

## Results
The model achieved an impressive accuracy score of **1.00**, indicating perfect predictions on the test set. This exceptional performance may suggest either an ideal dataset or potential overfitting.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the power of linear regression in predictive modeling for house prices. Further analysis is recommended to confirm the generalizability of the model.

## Future Work
- Experiment with more complex models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
